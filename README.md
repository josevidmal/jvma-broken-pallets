# jvma-broken-pallets
Broken Pallets is a MERN Stack application that lets companies offer their damaged plastic pallets to recyclers and plastic manufacturers, at a residual price.

## Description

Broken Pallets is a MERN application that allows companies to create an account, login and place offers of their damaged plastic pallets at a residual price of their original value. These damaged pallets may be waste for those companies, but for recyclers and plastic manufacturers those pallets can be transformed into raw material. So, the application helps them to find fast and in one place all the damaged plastic pallets they want to buy.

## Motivation

What I want to achieve with Broken Pallets is to help companies reduce the environmental impact that their damaged plastic pallets can have if disposed incorrectly. The app gives them an alternative to generate some profit from something that is just waste for them, but that may be a valuable resource for recyclers and plastic manufacturers with the capabilities to transform those damaged plastic pallets into resins to produce new products. Plastic is not the problem, the problem is how we use it and dispose of it.

## User Story

- As a Company that uses plastic pallets
- I want to be able to create an account in an application and login
- So that I can place offers of my damaged plastic pallets at a residual price of their original value, getting rid of them while making some profit

- As a recycler or plastic manufacturer
- I want to be able to create an account in an application and login
- So that I can find fast and in one place, damaged plastic pallets, to buy them at a residual price, obtaining plastic resources to recycle and generate raw material
